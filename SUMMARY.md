## 🚀 Next Steps: Add Your Notebooks!

### **👉 START HERE: [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md)**

This file contains everything you need to:
1. Copy your .ipynb files from VS Code
2. Organize them by topic
3. Push to GitHub
4. Publish your work!

### Quick Command Reference

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the repository
cd Mathimatics_for_Data_Science_Portofolio

# 2. Copy your notebooks
cp /path/to/your/notebooks/*.ipynb ./notebooks/

# Or organize by topic:
cp /path/to/linear_algebra.ipynb ./01_Linear_Algebra/
cp /path/to/calculus.ipynb ./02_Calculus/

# 3. Add data files if needed
cp /path/to/your/data/*.csv ./data/

# 4. Check what's changed
git status

# 5. Add all your files
git add .

# 6. Commit your work
git commit -m "Add my master's report notebooks"
