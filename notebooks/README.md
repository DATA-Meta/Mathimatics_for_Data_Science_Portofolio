## Running the Notebooks

1. Make sure you have installed all requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Navigate to this directory and open any notebook

## Tips

- Run cells sequentially (Shift + Enter)
- Experiment with parameters
- Try the exercises at the end of each notebook
- Create your own variations
